# 📢 MARKETING CHAT STARTER

**Use this to start a marketing strategy chat for Family Care Dashboard**

---

## 📋 **WHAT TO SAY TO START THE CHAT:**

```
I'm launching an open source project called "Family Care Dashboard" 
(working name) that helps families with elderly loved ones stay organized.

It's a self-hosted smart calendar that displays on TV, syncs with 
Google Calendar, and is designed for seniors (big text, simple UI).

Key differentiators:
- FREE (no subscriptions)
- PRIVATE (self-hosted, no cloud tracking)
- ELDER-FRIENDLY (designed for seniors, not tech experts)
- OPEN SOURCE (Apache 2.0 license)

Main competitors are Mango Display ($5-15/mo) and DAKboard ($5-9/mo).

I have complete marketing strategy documentation here:
https://github.com/MatoTeziTanka/Family-Care-Ideas/blob/main/docs/MARKETING-HANDOVER.md

After reading that, let's create:
1. Launch strategy for Reddit, Hacker News, and forums
2. Content calendar (blog posts, videos, social media)
3. Press outreach plan
4. Community building strategy

Target launch: This week (soft launch), next week (community launch).
```
