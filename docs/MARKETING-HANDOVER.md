## 📝 **REDDIT POST TEMPLATE**

**Title:** "I built a free, self-hosted smart calendar for my grandparents (open source)"

**Body:**
```
My grandparents kept missing appointments because they couldn't see their 
Google Calendar. Commercial solutions like Mango Display cost $5-15/month 
and I didn't trust them with my family's data.

So I built a free alternative using MagicMirror²/React (open source) that:
- Displays on any TV (cast or HDMI)
- Syncs with Google Calendar
- Works with Google Assistant
- Self-hosted for privacy
- Elder-friendly (big text, high contrast)

Setup took ~2 hours. Now it runs on a Raspberry Pi connected to their 
living room TV. They see appointments, weather, and family photos all day.

Happy to answer questions!
